# Coder Ipsum

So what had happened was...

I was building a dumb web app to teach people how to make it faster, but none of the existing ipsums really felt right for a workshop for developers. I got together with some friends and brainstormed computer science thought-leadership synergistic words, and this is what came out.

The website version is deployed [here](https://siakaramalegos.github.io/coder-ipsum/).

## Contributing

Yes, you can contribute! Features I'd like to develop:

- Turn this into an npm package so it's a tool like the [Faker Ruby gem](https://github.com/stympy/faker).
- Provide a Mad-Lib option with fake sentences (subject, verb, object, etc.).

If you have other ideas, feel free to contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheGreenGreek).

## Thanks

Thanks to [Chas McMahon](https://github.com/chas-mcmahon) and [Chris Guzman](https://twitter.com/speaktochris) for the initial synergy.
