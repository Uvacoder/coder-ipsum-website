# Coder Ipsum

So what had happened was...

I was building a dumb web app to teach people how to make it faster, but none of the existing ipsums really felt right for a workshop for developers. I got together with some friends and brainstormed computer science thought-leadership synergistic words, and this is what came out.

The website version is deployed [here](https://coder-ipsum.tech).


## Thanks

Thanks to [Chas McMahon](https://github.com/chas-mcmahon) and [Chris Guzman](https://twitter.com/speaktochris) for the initial synergy.
